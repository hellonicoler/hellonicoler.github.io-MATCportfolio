## About

This is an about page where your can talk about your professional experience and academic interests. This page is written in Markdown, a markup language that's intentionally easy to read and write. For a quick rundown, check out [GitHub's guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). 

You can also add a call to action by creating a button below:
      
[View my work](/projects){: .btn}

or

[Email me](mailto:username@email.com){: .btn}

What happens when I do this? How do I link to this page?

> Note that these buttons are unique to this theme and are **not** standard in Markdown.
